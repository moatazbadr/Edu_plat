3. **Configure the Database:**

      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> If the project uses SQL Server or another database, make sure to set up your database accordingly.

      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> Update the connection string in the **appsettings.json** file to match your database configuration

4. **Install Dependencies:**
      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> In Visual Studio, the NuGet packages will be restored automatically when you open the project. However, if not, you can manually restore the packages by running:

 6. **Test the API::**
  
     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> You can use tools like Postman to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints.

     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> The API will be available at https://localhost:5001/api (or the configured port).

**Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification on any step!**

This setup assumes that the project uses a SQL Server or similar database and includes the default setup for .NET 8. Let me know if there‚Äôs any specific configuration or part you want to adjust!
