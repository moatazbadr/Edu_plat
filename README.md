   Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SALEH-SHERIF/Edu_plat.git

2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio:**
      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> After cloning the repository, open the project in Visual Studio by navigating to the project folder and opening the .sln file
 
3. **Configure the Database:**

      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> If the project uses SQL Server or another database, make sure to set up your database accordingly.

      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> Update the connection string in the **appsettings.json** file to match your database configuration

4. **Install Dependencies:**
      <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> In Visual Studio, the NuGet packages will be restored automatically when you open the project. However, if not, you can manually restore the packages by running:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
5. **Run the Project:**

     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> In Visual Studio, press F5 or click "Start Debugging" to run the project.
   
     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> The Web API should now be running locally, typically accessible at
     ``` https://localhost:5001 or https://localhost:5000 ```
 
 6. **Test the API::**
  
     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> You can use tools like Postman to send HTTP requests to your API endpoints.

     <span style="font-size: 20px;">‚óè</span> The API will be available at https://localhost:5001/api (or the configured port).

**Feel free to reach out if you need further clarification on any step!**

This setup assumes that the project uses a SQL Server or similar database and includes the default setup for .NET 8. Let me know if there‚Äôs any specific configuration or part you want to adjust!

##  Pre-built Executable

1. **Download & Extract**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/SALEH-SHERIF/Edu_plat/releases).
   - Download the `.zip`/`.exe` (Windows) or `.tar.gz` (macOS) file.
   - Extract:
     - *Windows*: right-click ‚Üí Extract All...
     - *macOS*:  
       ```bash
       tar -xzf Edu_plat_mac.tar.gz
       ```

2. **Run the Application**
   - *Windows*: Open **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**, navigate to the folder containing `Edu_plat.exe`, and run:
     ```bash
     .\Edu_plat.exe
     ```
   - *macOS/Linux*: Open **Terminal**, navigate to the folder containing `Edu_plat`, and run:
     ```bash
     chmod +x Edu_plat && ./Edu_plat
     ```

3. **Access the API**
   - After the API starts, it will listen on the default port. You should see a message like:
     ```
     Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7189
     ```

4. **Access Swagger UI**
   - To interact with the API using Swagger UI, navigate to:
     [http://localhost:7189/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:7189/swagger/index.html)


> **Notes:**
> - If you have trouble accessing the API, make sure port `7198` is not blocked by another program or firewall.
> - To access the API from another device on the same network, replace `localhost` with the IP address of your machine.  
>   For example: `https://192.168.1.10:7198/api/...`


##  Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and how to resolve them:

### ‚ùå Database Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Unable to connect to the database.
- **Solution**:  
  - Ensure the correct server name and authentication method are used in `appsettings.json`.
  - Make sure the SQL Server service is running.
  - Check firewall settings on your machine.

### ‚ùå Entity Framework Migrations Not Working
- **Problem**: Errors when applying migrations.
- **Solution**:  
  - Delete the `Migrations/` folder.
  - Re-create the initial migration and apply it:
    ```bash
    dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
    dotnet ef database update
    ```

### ‚ùå Port Conflict
- **Problem**: The application port is already in use.
- **Solution**:  
  - Open `Properties/launchSettings.json` and change the `applicationUrl` to an available port (e.g., `https://localhost:7199`).

### ‚ùå SSL Warnings in Browser
- **Problem**: Browser shows warning for untrusted certificate.
- **Solution**:  
  - Trust the development SSL certificate using:
    ```bash
    dotnet dev-certs https --trust
    ```

### ‚ùå Upload Size Limit Exceeded
- **Problem**: File uploads fail with large files.
- **Solution**:  
  - Increase `MaxRequestBodySize` in `Program.cs`, or configure limits in your reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx/IIS).

### ‚ùå Missing Configuration Keys
- **Problem**: JWT/SMTP/Firebase settings are missing or incorrect.
- **Solution**:  
  - Double-check your `appsettings.json` and `secrets.json` for required keys like `Jwt:Key`, `Smtp:Host`, etc.
